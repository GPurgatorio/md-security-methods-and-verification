# Security Methods and Verification

The exam consists in 2 parts: a written test + presentation (45-60 mins), generally on formal methods for security.

- **Exam** This folder contains the given exam and my submitted answers.
- **Gradual Release.pptx** My final presentation, about Gradual Release. Notes contain some hints on what is being explained, and in the first slide there's the reference to the paper.
- **Resume.pdf** A resume of what we studied during the course. It's not very user-friendly, because I've written it during lessons and never reformatted it. Note: there may be errors!
